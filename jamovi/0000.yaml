    description: >
      The Kruskal-Wallis test is used to explore the relationship between a
      continuous dependent variable, and a categorical explanatory variable. It
      is analagous to ANOVA, but with the advantage of being non-parametric and
      having fewer assumptions. However, it has the limitation that it can only
      test a single explanatory variable at a time. Conover-Iman and Dunn test
      are available to report results across multiple pairwise comparisons.
